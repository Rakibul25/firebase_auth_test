# Introduction
This project is mainly focused on login and signup that uses Firebase and Firestore to provide users with a seamless and secure experience. With this app, users can easily create an account, sign in using different authentication methods, and access key features to achieve their goals.

The app supports manual signup, allowing users to create an account using their name, email, and password. Users can also choose to sign up with their Facebook or Google account, making the process faster and more convenient.

In addition, the app has a built-in feature to validate email and password inputs. This means that the app will check whether the email is a valid email format and whether the password meets the minimum requirements (such as minimum length, uppercase letters, or special characters). This ensures that users create strong and secure passwords and helps to prevent unauthorized access to their accounts.

Overall, it provides a simple and effective way for users to create accounts and securely access key features using Firebase and Firestore.
